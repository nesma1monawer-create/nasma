title: Crossing Horizons
info: At Crossing Horizons, we highlight the strength and creativity of female
  newcomer artists in the Netherlands through immersive exhibitions,
  installations, and public dialogues. Founded by creative producer and social
  entrepreneur Wafa Al-Attas, we challenge stereotypes, rethink the language of
  “integration,” and create spaces where newcomers are recognized not as guests,
  but as neighbours, colleagues, and co-creators of society.
