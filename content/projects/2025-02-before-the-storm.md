info: BEFORE THE STORM is a collaborative project by MOHA, created with a
  working group of local residents and creatives. Together, they explored the
  skills, strategies, and forms of resilience people use when facing their own
  personal storms. These insights were transformed into communal tools and
  poetic gestures that visitors can engage with and take home.

      **The Storm** 


      It is a hard time, A difficult period. 


      It could be outside or deep inside. 


      It could be personal or collective. 


      It comes in many forms: Tangible and intangible, Seen and unseen, Loud and subtle, Expected and sudden. 


      We’ve all been through storms, Different kinds. Some are light, some are heavy. 


      Some pass quickly, some stay for a while. 


      Everyone’s storm looks different, What does yours look like? 


      And how do you manage to get through it?
