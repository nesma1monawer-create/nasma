info: "The Storm It is a hard time, A difficult period. It could be outside or
  deep inside. It could be personal or collective. It comes in many forms:
  Tangible and intangible, Seen and unseen, Loud and subtle, Expected and
  sudden. We’ve all been through storms, Different kinds. Some are light, some
  are heavy. Some pass quickly, some stay for a while. Everyone’s storm looks
  different, What does yours look like? And how do you manage to get through
  it?"
