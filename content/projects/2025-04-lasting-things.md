      Objects are never just things. A photo, a key, or a notebook carries
      memories, loss, and hope

      that often cannot be captured in words.


      With *Lasting Things,* I want to show that an object is never silent. I want to bring life back into what we consider lifeless. An object becomes a carrier of a person, a past, and a story. In my imagination, there is room for everything — for people and for things. My imaginative world has no boundaries.


      In these photos, you see a boat on the border between Turkey and Greece. That boat represents a new beginning. But the same sea is a grave for many others. In a single image, hope and loss exist

      side by side.


      Borders feel like artificial lines to me. But for others, those lines determine whether a life can continue — or ends. Whether a bag remains filled with dreams or with memories.


      **Lasting Things** is a travelling exhibition that makes these quiet stories visible — the lives that continue to exist within objects.
