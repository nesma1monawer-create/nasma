projectDescription: |-
  We are here— from many places,
  carrying different names, languages, and histories.
  We share our stories.
  We question because we care.
  We critique because we want to belong.
  We speak in fragments, in memories, in truths too often ignored.
  We are told to be grateful— and we are.
  But not in silence.
  Our gratitude is not submission.
  It is a voice. It is a will to be seen.
  We gather not for empathy, but to be understood.
  Not to be pitied, but to be heard:
  fully, equally, as humans.
  I am Grateful (?!) is a platform:
  a place for dialogue,
  a space where borders dissolve,
  where emotions matter,
  where silence becomes speech,
  and stories shift the frame.
  This is a place to listen, to feel,
  to confront, to imagine.
  You may find echoes of your own story here— or perhaps
  you are witnessing these realities for the first time.
  Wherever you stand, let listening be your beginning.
