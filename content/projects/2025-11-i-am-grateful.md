projectDescription: Imagine a space where time stands still—not for minutes, but
  for months and years. A space where stories remain unheard, and where waiting
  becomes a way of life.

      Refugee centers are waiting rooms of a different kind. In the Netherlands,
      they are often hidden from view—yet they are everywhere. Places of
      suspended time, where lives are placed on hold in uncertainty. Arrival
      here is not the end of a journey, but the beginning of another: a slow
      struggle for agency, recognition, and belonging.


      I am Grateful (?!) is an installation born from these realities. Initially created by Nasma Alshutfa as a personal series of miniatures—each room a story, a fragment of experience—it has since evolved into a collective work. In the second phase, new voices joined, the team expanded, and the installation became a shared space of storytelling. Together, we invite you to step inside—to witness both the intimate emotions and the political conditions that shape the lives of asylum seekers. We ask you not to look away, but to engage—with curiosity, with understanding, and with questions. 


      What began as a personal reflection on Nasma Alshutfa’s own two-year experience has grown into a collective installation. New rooms have been added, shaped by the voices of others. Her story now sits alongside theirs - creating a shared space of testimony, memory, and belonging.


      This work exposes visible borders, the ones that divide nations, as well as invisible borders: those embedded in laws, prejudice, and cultural barriers. These unseen walls leave profound marks on identity, belonging, and the possibility of home.


      Through co-created narratives and testimonies gathered from people of diverse backgrounds who are living or have lived in AZCs across the Netherlands, I am Grateful (?!) makes the hidden visible. It gives form to the complex emotions of living in transit—where destinations are uncertain, control is lost, and comfort must always remain temporary.

          This first storytelling workshop served as an introductory gathering
          for participants who are living or have lived in different refugee
          centres. The session aimed to:

          Build trust and create a safe environment.

          Encourage participants to get to know one another.

          Offer a day out and an opportunity to meet new people.

          Provide space to share experiences and reduce feelings of isolation.

          Introduce the project and allow participants to choose how they wish to be involved.

          Begin collecting general insights into participants’ stories.

          Help participants to position themselves within the project and decide what they feel comfortable sharing.

        info: >
          In this session, we dove into the WHAT and HOW of personal stories,
          focusing on life inside AZCs (asylum seeker centers). We asked
          participants reflective questions — exploring both personal experience
          and spatial imagination.

          WHAT

          What was the worst AZC you've stayed in — and why?

          What problems do society never see?

          What do you love/hate about your room?

          What message do you want to share with the world — inside or outside the AZC?

          What’s missing in your room, and what would you add?

          HOW

          Can you draw your room(s) and show where they sit within the AZC?

          If you could design a room to express a feeling about the invisible borders, what would that feeling be — and why?

          What if there were 5 rooms, each showing a border you experience — what would you name each one?

        info: It is important for the participants to be directly involved in building
          their rooms, shaping the details, and ensuring that the space truly
          reflects their ideas and experiences. This process helps them feel
          connected to the room and grounded in it.

          The opening event exceeded expectations, welcoming around 50 attendees
          from across our network, including researchers, architects, artists,
          and representatives from various institutions and organisations.

          The programme began with a welcome speech by Imagine IC’s manager, Danielle Kuijten, followed by an introduction from Nasma Alshutfa as the project leader. Each member of the I Am Grateful team — Dona, Wafa, Ibtehal, Osman, Hadi, Hadir, Buthaina, and Samira — spoke about their role in the project, their emotions throughout the process, and the experiences they contributed. Their openness and enthusiasm created a warm and engaging atmosphere.

          As the I Am Grateful team, we focused fully on guiding visitors through the installation and facilitating conversations around the work. Participants stood proudly beside their rooms, engaging in long, meaningful conversations with visitors. Seeing them speak with confidence and ownership was a powerful moment, affirming the project’s core aim: using spatial design as a tool for dialogue, storytelling, and shared understanding.

          The event concluded with food and traditional music, creating a warm, communal atmosphere. It was a successful gathering both practically and emotionally — a moment of connection, listening, and celebration for everyone involved.
